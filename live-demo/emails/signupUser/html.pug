p Hi,
p You have just created an account on GraphQL Authentication Demo! As a last step, please confirm your email by writing this mutation:
pre
  | mutation {
  |   confirmEmail(email: "#{email}", emailConfirmToken: "#{emailConfirmToken}") {
  |     token
  |   }
  | }

p
  em In a real-world application the user wouldn't have to run the mutation itself of course, it would something like this:<br />
  a(href=mailAppUrl + '/confirm-email/' + email + '/' + emailConfirmToken) Confirm your email.
